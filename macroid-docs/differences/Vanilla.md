# Differences from vanilla Android

## XML vs code

Android XML UI layouts have quite a few disadvantages:

* *Only one layout per file*

  If you want to build a layout from smaller pieces, each one has to be put in its own file,
  greatly boosting the number of files and making it hard to track.

  *Macroid* lets you define layouts anywhere in any quantities, using plain Scala code.

* *No namespacing*

  No folders are allowed, thus all layouts, including those small pieces, that may be only
  relevant for a particular activity, pollute the IDE sidebars.

  *Macroid* leverages the power of Scala’s modular aspect: by using `object`s and flexible
  `import`s, any desired namespacing can be achieved for layouts, styles, behaviors, etc.

* *Folders for different screen sizes*

  While this adaptation mechanism is relatively easy to use, it’s not very flexible.

  *Macroid* provides media queries, which allow you to define composable adaptive
  pieces of layouts or behaviors.

* *Code required anyway*

  Glue code finding widgets by ids and assigning event handlers feels a bit weird.

  Before you tell me that it’s about separating looks from behaviors, *Macroid*
  does not stand in the way of this separation at all! Widgets can be wired to
  variables and manipulated somewhere else.

Of course, there are advantages too:

* *XML layouts can be edited visually*

  (Although it does not help much if you are populating them dynamically.)

* *Immediate feedback*

  Editing XML layouts is very fast and straightforward. On the contrary,
  updating *Macroid* layouts requires recompiling and rerunning the app.
  Still, with proper incremental compiler ([sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)) and
  ProGuard cache ([android-sdk-plugin](https://github.com/pfn/android-sdk-plugin))
  this normaly takes a mere 20 seconds. And you can always use dedicated sketching
  tools to develop the UI look even faster than with XML.

## High-level abstractions

*Macroid* supports generalized widget tweaking, for example you can take
a textbox and assign it some text, that will only be available in a few seconds:

```scala
val futureText = Future {
  Thread.sleep(5000) // used as an example, never use sleep in real code ;)
  text("Hi!")
}
myTextView <~ futureText
```

## Safer implicit context

*Macroid* uses `WeakReference`s to store `Context`s other than `Application`. This helps to automatically avoid
[memory leaks](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3346080/android-references-to-a-context-and-memory-leaks).

## Safer threading

As we know from the Android documentation,

> The Andoid UI toolkit is not thread-safe. So, you must not manipulate your UI from a worker thread—you must do all manipulation to your user interface from the UI thread.

*Macroid* wraps any UI manipulation in a so-called UI action.
UI actions can be combined to be run in a batch, and have a method to be sent to the
UI thread for execution.

## Unique features

*Macroid* boasts several unique features. For example, [Snails](../guide/Snails.html) provide
a mini data-flow language to create animations and other “slow” behaviors.
[Layout transformers](../guide/Transformers.html) employ the power of pattern matching
to tweak nested layouts. Browsing the [guide](Guide.html) will give you a sense of what
else is possible with *Macroid*.
